# Error-measures-for-random-social-networks

This repository presents the sorcecode to compute error measures $\epsilon$ and $\epsilon_N$ for random graphs using ``networkx`` and the data generated for small-world and scale-free networks.

*  The folder ``Notebook`` includes the Jupyter Notebook.
*  The folder ``data`` contains the data for several random runs.
